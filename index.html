						</div>
						<br>
						<p>Baja SAE is a Collegiate Design Series competition run by the Society of Automotive Engineers International (SAE International). The goal in Baja SAE is to design, build and race off-road vehicles that can withstand the harshest elements of rough terrain (Vehicles are 4-wheel off roaders)</p>
						<br>
						<p>I started on the design team as a member of the electrical subdivision, working on data acquisition for a dynamometer and sensor integration. In my final year, I led the software development of the team. Here's some accomplishments I am proud of:</p>
						<br>
						<p>• Spearheaded a team of 10 people to redesign and implement a new data acquisition system using a Teensy and Raspberry Pi, helping the team to a 6th-place finish in the endurance race at Baja SAE Oshkosh 2023</p>
						<br>
						<p>• Assisted vehicle driver capabilities by developing a real-time driver dashboard displaying sensor outputs including speed, engine RPM, engine temperature, and estimated fuel </p>
						<br>
						<p>• Developed a custom CAN bus library to facilitate SD data logging of sensor data during competition in C++, assisting other sub-teams tune their equipment and CAD designs </p>
